## API Key Authentication

All endpoints (except `/health`) require authentication via API key.

### Using the SDK

The SDK handles authentication automatically when you provide your API key:

```javascript
const client = new In10ntClient({
  apiKey: 'your_api_key'
});
```

### Environment Variables

You can also set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export IN10NT_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Then initialize the client without explicitly passing the key:

```javascript
const client = new In10ntClient({
  apiKey: process.env.IN10NT_API_KEY
});
```

## Direct API Requests

If you're making direct API requests without the SDK, include your API key in the Authorization header:

### Bearer Token (Recommended)

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://in10t-api-v2.fly.dev/instances
```

### X-API-Key Header (Alternative)

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://in10t-api-v2.fly.dev/instances
```

## Base URL

The default API base URL is:

```
https://in10t-api-v2.fly.dev
```

You can override this when initializing the client:

```javascript
const client = new In10ntClient({
  apiKey: 'your_api_key',
  baseURL: 'https://custom-api-url.com'
});
```

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  Never commit API keys to version control. Always use environment variables or secure secret management.
</Warning>

- Store API keys in environment variables
- Use different keys for development and production
- Rotate keys regularly
- Never expose keys in client-side code
- Use secret management services (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
